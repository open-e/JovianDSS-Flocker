## Description

This repository contains source files for the Open-E JovianDSS ClusterHQ/flocker driver/plugin.


## Installation

To make Open-E JovianDSS work properly with your Flocker base environment you have to install it on every Agent node.

Ensure that you have lsscsi and iscsi-initiator-utils installed. 
On the rpm based systems you can install them by running:

### Install driver and tools

```bash
yum -y install lsscsi
yum -y install iscsi-initiator-utils
```

Install latest code from repository:

```bash
sudo $PATH_TO_PIP/pip install git+https://github.com/open-e/Flocker-driver.git
```



### Configure driver

Create and edit the joviandss_flocker_conf.yml config file. It is expected to be at "/etc/flocker/joviandss_flocker_conf.yml" 
```bash
"jovian_host" : "192.168.0.128"
"jovian_rest_protocol" : "https"
"jovian_rest_port" : 82
"jovian_user" : "admin"
"jovian_password" : "admin"
"jovian_iscsi_target_portal_port" : 3260
"jovian_target_prefix" : "iqn.2016-04.com.open-e:"
"jovian_pool" : "Pool-0"
"jovian_rest_send_repeats" : 3
"flocker_allocation_unit" : 1073741824
"flocker_instance_id" : "node1"
```

| jovian\_host   | 	               | IP address of the JovianDSS | 
| jovian\_rest\_protocol 	| https | Protocol to connect to JovianDSS. Https must be enabled on the JovianDSS site [1].  |
| jovian\_rest\_port | 82               | Must be set according to the settings in [1] |

| jovian\_password   | admin            | Must be set according to the settings in [1] |
| jovian\_iscsi\_target\_portal\_port | 3260 | Port for iSCSI connection               |
| jovian\_target\_prefix | iqn.2016-04.com.open-e: | Prefix that will be used to form target name for volume |
| jovian\_pool | Pool-0 | Pool name that is going to be used to store volumes. Must be created in [2] |
| jovian\_rest\_send\_repeats | 3 | Number of times that CinderDriver will provide to send REST request. |
| flocker\_allocation\_unit | 1073741824 | Set for the Flocker minimal allocation unit. |
| flocker\_instance\_id |   | Unique text string that can contain [0-9] [a-z] and '-'. Should not be *MORE* longer then 36 symbols |



[1] Can be enabled by going to: JovianDSS Web interface/System Settings/REST Access 

[2] [Can be created by going to JovianDSS Web interface/Storage](https://www.open-e.com/site_media/download/documents/Open-E-JovianDSS-High-Availability-Cluster-Step-by-Step.pdf)

Create and edit flocker agent config file agent.yml. It is expected to be at "/etc/flocker/agent.yml" 

```bash
version: 1
control-service:
   hostname: "192.168.0.4"
dataset:
    backend: "jovian_dss_driver"
    joviandss_conf_file: "/etc/flocker/flocker_jovian_dss_conf.yml"
```

| Property   	|  Description 	|
|:----------:	|  :------:	|
| hostname   | 	IP address of the host with control service | 
| backend 	| name of the driver you are going yo use ---  joviandss_driver  |
| joviandss_conf_file  | file that stores configs for JovianDSS driver --- joviandss_flocker_conf.yml  |


### ReStart services

Ensure that appropriate services is running:

```bash
systemctl stop flocker-dataset-agent
systemctl enable flocker-dataset-agent
systemctl start flocker-dataset-agent

systemctl stop flocker-container-agent
systemctl enable flocker-container-agent
systemctl start flocker-container-agent
```

## Testing

Now your should have your Flocker agent able to use JovianDSS driver.

Run command:
```bash
flockerctl --control-service=192.168.0.4 list
```
You will get:
```bash
DATASET   SIZE   METADATA   STATUS   SERVER 
```
This means that you have no volumes created.

Run this command to see available nodes:
```bash
flockerctl --control-service=192.168.0.4 list-nodes
```

You will get something like this:
```bash
SERVER     ADDRESS
43a06d55   192.168.0.4 
430e9391   192.168.0.5
```
Run this command to create volume with size 1 Gigabyte
```bash
flockerctl --control-service=192.168.0.4 create -n 43a06d55 -s 1G
```
Now you can check status by running:
```bash
flockerctl --control-service=192.168.0.4 list
```
You will get something like this:
```bash
DATASET                                SIZE    METADATA   STATUS         SERVER
bef1f5c1-d8ef-4351-b495-2f03a9cae6ad   1.00G              attached âœ…   43a06d55 (192.168.0.4) 
```

Now you can check if you can 'move' volume from one node to another. Run command:
```bash
flockerctl --control-service=192.168.0.4 move -d 5030bb09-fe05-4285-af5c-911e64412071 -t 430e9391
```
This command will move volume 5030bb09-fe05-4285-af5c-911e64412071 to the node with ID 430e9391.

Now you can check updated status by running:
```bash
flockerctl --control-service=192.168.0.4 list
```

The response should looks like:
```bash
DATASET                                SIZE    METADATA   STATUS         SERVER 
5030bb09-fe05-4285-af5c-911e64412071   1.00G              attached     430e9391 (192.168.0.5) 
```

Now, if you are not interested in the volume, it can be easily removed by calling:
```bash
flockerctl --control-service=192.168.0.4 destroy -d 5030bb09-fe05-4285-af5c-911e64412071
```

Now you can check updated status by running:
```bash
flockerctl --control-service=192.168.0.4 list
```

The response should looks like:
```bash
DATASET                                SIZE    METADATA   STATUS         SERVER 

```

Driver is working. 


In other cases please check that your Flocker deployment is correct.
